API.\n- [README.md](https://github.com/unrs/unrs-resolver#unrs-resolver) for options.\n\n## API\n\n`resolve(directory, specifier)` - resolve `specifier` at an absolute path to a `directory`.\n\n### `directory`\n\nAn **absolute** path to a directory where the specifier is resolved against.\n\nFor CommonJS modules, it is the `__dirname` variable that contains the absolute path to the folder containing current module.\n\nFor ECMAScript modules, it is the value of `import.meta.url`.\n\nBehavior is undefined when given a path to a file.\n\n### `specifier`\n\nThe string passed to `require` or `import`, i.e. `require(\"specifier\")` or `import \"specifier\"`\n\n## ESM Example\n\n```javascript\nimport assert from 'assert';\nimport path from 'path';\nimport resolve, { ResolverFactory } from './index.js';\n\n// `resolve`\nassert(resolve.sync(process.cwd(), './index.js').path, path.join(cwd, 'index.js'));\n\n// `ResolverFactory`\nconst resolver = new ResolverFactory();\nassert(resolver.sync(process.cwd(), './index.js').path, path.join(cwd, 'index.js'));\n```\n","readmeFilename":"README.md"}
